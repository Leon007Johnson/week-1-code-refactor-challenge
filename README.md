# week-1-code-refactor-challenge
As a beginner in web developement I have been given a task to refactor old code and implement new code without changing the functionality or appearence of the webpage. I will be making changes to HTML and CSS to improve the coding in this challenge



Changes to element selector - <div class ="header"> to <header>
The 1st changes I have made to this code was to the HTML. When looking at the code on HTML document they had use a class seclector for the header. On HTML5 as there is now an element available for header I have refactored this onto the HTML code
After doing this I then changed the code on the CSS element. To incorporate this change on CSS, I have removed the "." in the ".header" as this has an element selector on HTML and no longer requires this class selector.

Changes to <div class="footer"> to <footer>
The second change I have made to the HTML code was to implement the same practive as the "header" to the "footer" element as there is also a element for this on HTML5 and applied the same practice on CSS and removed the "." in the ".footer" as the class selector is no longer needed and with these changes this has not changed the look of the website or functionality. 

Changes to element selector - <div class="content"> to <section>
The third change was to the class content. To neaten the code on HTML I have changed this to a section tag which groups the infomration in the articles. there have been no changes to functionality with these changes should help with future refactoring. After changing the element on the HTML code I then changed the code on CSS from ".content" to a "main element to correspond with the Elemnt refactored on HTML.

Changes to element - <div> to <main>
This last change was done to structure the side tag on the webpage and refactored the code on CSS from ".benefits" to the "main element.
